## Key Insights

### When to Use Agentic AI
✅ Complex, multi-step workflows
✅ Need for reasoning and decision-making
✅ Integration with multiple tools/APIs
✅ Personalization and context awareness

❌ Simple classification tasks
❌ Real-time latency requirements (<100ms)
❌ Deterministic, rule-based logic
❌ Cost-sensitive, high-volume operations

### Framework Selection Matrix

| Framework | Best For | Complexity | Cost |
|-----------|----------|------------|------|
| AgentCore | Enterprise, production | Low | $$$ |
| LangGraph | Custom workflows | Medium | $$ |
| CrewAI | Role-based teams | Low | $$ |
| AutoGen | Code generation | Medium | $$ |

### Production Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Observability and monitoring
- [ ] Error handling and fallbacks
