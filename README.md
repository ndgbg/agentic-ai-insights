## 💡 Key Insights

### When to Use Agentic AI

✅ **Good Fit:**
- Complex, multi-step workflows
- Need for reasoning and decision-making
- Integration with multiple tools/APIs
- Personalization and context awareness
- 24/7 availability required

❌ **Not a Good Fit:**
- Simple classification tasks
- Real-time latency requirements (<100ms)
- Deterministic, rule-based logic
- Cost-sensitive, high-volume operations (>1M/day)

### Framework Selection Matrix

| Framework | Best For | Complexity | Cost |
|-----------|----------|------------|------|
| AgentCore | Enterprise, production | Low | $$$ |
| LangGraph | Custom workflows | Medium | $$ |
| CrewAI | Role-based teams | Low | $$ |
| AutoGen | Code generation | Medium | $$ |

### Typical ROI

- **Break-even:** 3-6 months
- **Year 1 ROI:** 200-500%
- **Year 2+ ROI:** 500-1000%
